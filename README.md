# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases my skills, projects, and background as a developer. I created this portfolio to demonstrate my abilities and to provide a platform for potential employers or collaborators to learn more about me.

## Features

- **About Me**: Learn about my background, and career goals.
- **Skills**: A list of technologies I am proficient in, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more.
- **Projects**: A gallery of my projects, each with a brief description and links to their respective GitHub repositories.
- **Contact**: A form that allows visitors to send me a message directly(which is not working).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website and creating a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the website, such as the navigation menu and project gallery.
- **GitHub Pages**: The website is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.
